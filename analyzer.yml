# This is an example configuration file that can be used while running `npm run start` locally.

tests:
  - endpoint: 'http://www.google.com'   # Required. The endpoint that should be tested.
    type: http                          # Required. The requested analysis type. Currenrly supporting: dns, http, https
    options:                            # Optional. A set of additional options that should be tested for this specific analysis type.
      latency:                          # Optional. Tool will also test latency when configured. Can be either a boolean or an object.
        threshold: 0.01                 # Optional. A threshold that compares current latency with previous latency of test for specific type + endpoint. Can be either a number (seconds) or percentage.
      bandwidth:                        # Optional. Tool will also test download bandwidth when configured. Can be either a boolean or an object.
        threshold: 1%                   # Optional. A threshold that compares current bandwidth with previous bandwidth of test for specific type + endpoint. Can be either a number (Mbps) or percentage.
